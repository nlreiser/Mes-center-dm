12.	Always mark the Form Status ‘Complete’. Save and Exit Form.


## Completing the Data Request
1. After the Data Request Forms have been completed on REDCap, pull the required data. 
2. Save all files in the corresponding Data Request folder. 
3. If the Data Request is for a Collaborative Application, create the Collaborator folder within the Data Request folder. Store all files that will be shared with the Collaborator within the Collaborator folder. They will only have access to this specific folder, not the entire Data Request folder. 
4. Create a Data Dictionary – this should be stored in the Collaborator folder if there is one; otherwise, it can be stored in the general folder for this Data Request. See Step 3 for steps to create a data dictionary. 


## Creating the Data Dictionary
Note: The Data Dictionary will store all variables for the specific Data Request with information about each. This step should be completed for both internal data requests and collaborative application data requests to inform the receiver of the data on each of the variables. 

1. For each database used for the Data Request, navigate to the corresponding ‘Dictionary’ page which can be found on the left panel of REDCap.
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '60%', out.extra='style="background-color: #41444B; padding:2px;"', fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("data_dict_button.png")
```
2. Once on the Data Dictionary page, select ‘Download the current Data Dictionary’. A .csv file of all variables in the database will be downloaded. Open the downloaded file.  
3. Filter the Data Dictionary and delete any unneeded variables for the data request. 
4. Save the Data Dictionary in the Data Request folder, which should now consist of only the variables from a single database that were required for the Data Request. 
5. Compile all necessary variables from the database into a single .csv or .xlsx file by following the ['Data Dictionary Template'](https://nuwildcat.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/FSM-MesulamCenterDataMgmt/Shared%20Documents/Data%20Requests/2023-04-14_REDCap_Reports_SOP/Data_Dictionary_Template.xlsx?d=w1c9abe17e62340c19618191f3e9ff3dd&csf=1&web=1&e=EDyHIh).
    a. The headings should ALWAYS appear in this order with the Column Headers on line 13 and the first variable on line 14. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '100%', out.extra='style="background-color: #41444B; padding:2px;"', fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("dd_template.png")
```
6. If more than one database was used for the Data Request, repeat steps 1 – 4 for each database, adding each set of new variables to the same Data Dictionary. 
    a. When using multiple databases for a data request, create new ‘Variable Name’ columns, specifying which database the variable came from if they are not stored in all databases used. 
7. Save the Data Dictionary file with the following format: <i>Date_Data_Request_Name</i>_Metadata. Ex: 2023_05_23_Data_Request_SOP_Metadata.


## Documenting the Data Request
The purpose of the data documentation for a Data Request is to explain everything that was done. This should include:

* How the data was pulled – which databases were used; specify if the data was pulled via a REDCap report, through the API, or through some other method.
* What data was pulled – which variables were pulled from each database.
* What was done to the data after it was pulled – additional filtering or sorting, adding comments/variables, calculations, etc.

<b>A.</b> If the documentation only consists of a few sentences or a few short paragraphs, it can be entered directly into the Data Request Form Documentation textbox.

<b>B.</b> If the documentation requires a longer explanation, create a word document and paste the link to the documentation into the Data Request Form Documentation textbox. 


## Sending Data Out

1. Create a new folder within the specific Data Request folder in SharePoint with the following format: <i>Date_MesCtr_Data_Request_Name_</i>Dataset. Ex: 2023_05_23_Data_Request_SOP_Dataset.
2. Move the finalized data dictionary to this folder.  
3. Add the data to this folder with the following format: <i>Date_Data_Request_Name_</i>Data. Ex: 2023_05_23_Data_Request_SOP_Data.
    a. Note: the data should be stored within a .csv or .xlsx file, or both. 
4. Within this folder, add another folder for all Documentation. Title this folder ‘Documentation’. 
    a. This is where the Documentation, scoring guidelines, and any other manuals for the data request will be stored.
