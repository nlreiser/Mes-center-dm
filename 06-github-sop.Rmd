# Github SOP 

## Creating a new page on the Mesulam Center Data Management Practices website. 
1. Create a new r Markdown file and save in the following format: 
    chapter number-title.Rmd (ex. 06-github-sop.Rmd)

2. Headings:
A single # is used to title the chapter page. (Github SOP at the top of the page)
## Double ## is used for a Heading and Section Title in the Table of Contents on 
the right hand side. 
### Triple ### is used for a Subheading and Sub-section Title in the Table of Contents 
on the right hand side. 
Note: Github and Bookdown automatically numbers the Table of contents based on the 
saved name of the R Markdown file.
