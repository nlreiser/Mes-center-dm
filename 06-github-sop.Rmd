# Github SOP 

## Adding a Chapter to this site. 

### Adding the RMarkdown File Locally
1. In the local Data Request folder for the Mesulam Center Data Management
Practices site, open the .Rproj file. Create a new r Markdown file and save it 
in the following format: \n
chapter number-title.Rmd (ex: 06-github-sop.Rmd)

2. Add Headings: \n
A single # is used to title the chapter page. (Github SOP at the top of the page) \n
## Double ## is used for a Heading and Section Title in the Table of Contents on 
the right hand side. \n
### Triple ### is used for a Subheading and Sub-section Title in the Table of Contents 
on the right hand side. \n
Note: Github and Bookdown automatically numbers the Table of contents based on the 
saved name of the R Markdown file. 

3. Add Body: \n
Add body of text as needed. 

4. Save the Rmarkdown file. Close the file and open the project file in RStudio.
